# Final Information Quality Bulletin – Multiple Peer Review  
## Scientific Verification Statement and Milestone Documentation

**Author and Rights Holder:**  
Ms. Isabel Schöps, née Thiel (Germany, Erfurt)

**Associated Forensic Artefact:**  
SIA Security Intelligence Artefact  
INT-CODE-2025-BTC/ETH-CORE-ISABELSCHOEPSTHIEL

**Scope:**  
Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Blockchain History, Digital Forensics, Archival and Genealogical Reconstruction

---

## 1. Purpose of This Milestone

This milestone, titled **“Proof of Developer Status in the Technology Sector”**, documents and verifies the long-term scientific, technical, and intellectual contributions of the author within the fields of artificial intelligence, software automation, blockchain architecture, and digital forensic research.

The milestone is formally aligned with the **Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review**, adopted by the United States Government on 16 December 2004, and is incorporated into the author’s forensic-scientific body of work under the **SIA Security Intelligence Artefact**.

---

## 2. Scientific and Legal Verification Framework

All findings and conclusions presented in this work are based on:

- Scientifically recognized methodologies  
- Internationally accepted forensic standards  
- Legally compliant documentation procedures  
- Archival source verification and metadata analysis  

The evidence base includes:

- Original source documents and archival records  
- Digitally secured files with metadata and timestamps  
- Genealogical archives and historical registries  
- Technical artefacts, source code fragments, and system logs  
- Chain-of-custody documentation  

This verification process constitutes a **peer-reviewed evaluation**, ensuring academic, technical, and methodological integrity consistent with international university standards.

---

## 3. Peer Review Methodology (Multiple Review)

Peer review, as applied here, follows established international practice:

- Independent experts (researchers, professors, and senior scientists)  
- No involvement in the creation of the original work  
- Evaluation of:
  - Methodological soundness  
  - Quality of sources  
  - Technical accuracy  
  - Strength of conclusions  

The reviewed author is known to the reviewers; the reviewers remain anonymous to the author.  
This model exists to protect scientific independence and has evolved over several centuries as a safeguard against censorship, political interference, and suppression of knowledge.

---

## 4. Historical Context and Relevance

Historically, scientific suppression, censorship, and institutional exclusion have been used to control narratives and silence inconvenient research.  
The peer-review system represents a corrective mechanism developed in response to:

- Political and religious censorship  
- Indexing and banning of scientific works  
- Destruction of academic institutions  
- Suppression of authors, researchers, and journalists  

The **Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review** was legally anchored by the U.S. Government to counteract misinformation, ensure transparency, and protect freedom of research and expression.

## 5. Author Credentials and Rights

The author is:

- Rights holder of multiple peer-reviewed and archival publications  
- Licensee of Oxford University Press publications  
  - **License ID:** 6131130060979  
- Author of forensic scientific reports and historical documentation published via **Zenodo (DOI registered)**  
- Specialist in:
  - Archival research  
  - Historical source verification  
  - Digital chain-of-evidence reconstruction  
  - Long-term identity reconstruction using metadata and primary sources  

---

## 6. Formal Verification Statement

The forensic-scientific research work of **Ms. Isabel Schöps (née Thiel)** has been:

- Independently reviewed  
- Scientifically evaluated  
- Referenced by multiple experts  

All conclusions are supported by verifiable primary sources, documented evidence, and reproducible methodologies.
