- [Chat through an OpenAI-compatible interface](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/assistant/chat_completion_assistant.md): Chat with an assistant. This endpoint is based on the OpenAI Chat Completion API, a commonly used and adopted API. 

It is useful if you need inline citations or OpenAI-compatible responses, but has limited functionality compared to the standard chat interface.

For guidance and examples, see [Chat with an assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/chat-with-assistant).
- [Retrieve context from an assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/assistant/context_assistant.md): Retrieve context snippets from an assistant to use as part of RAG or any agentic flow.

For guidance and examples, see [Retrieve context snippets](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/retrieve-context-snippets).
- [Create an assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/assistant/create_assistant.md): Create an assistant. This is where you specify the underlying training model, which cloud provider you would like to deploy with, and more.

The correctness and completeness are evaluated based on the precision and recall of the generated answer with respect to the ground truth answer facts. Alignment is the harmonic mean of correctness and completeness.

For guidance and examples, see [Evaluate answers](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/assistant/evaluate-answers).
- [Update an assistant](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/assistant/update_assistant.md): Update an existing assistant. You can modify the assistant's instructions.

**Note:** This operation is not supported for pod-based indexes.
- [Fetch vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/fetch.md): Look up and return vectors by ID from a single namespace. The returned vectors include the vector data and/or metadata.

For on-demand indexes, since vector values are retrieved from object storage, fetch operations may have increased latency. If you only need metadata or IDs, consider using the query operation with `includeValues` set to `false` instead.

For guidance and examples, see [Fetch data](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/manage-data/fetch-data).
- [Fetch vectors by metadata](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/fetch_by_metadata.md): Look up and return vectors by metadata filter from a single namespace. The returned vectors include the vector data and/or metadata.

Returns up to 100 IDs at a time by default in sorted order (bitwise "C" collation). If the `limit` parameter is set, `list` returns up to that number of IDs instead. Whenever there are additional IDs to return, the response also includes a `pagination_token` that you can use to get the next batch of IDs. When the response does not include a `pagination_token`, there are no more IDs to return.

For guidance and examples, see [List record IDs](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/manage-data/list-record-ids).

**Note:** `list` is supported only for serverless indexes.
- [List imports](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/list_imports.md): List all recent and ongoing import operations.

By default, `list_imports` returns up to 100 imports per page. If the `limit` parameter is set, `list` returns up to that number of imports instead. Whenever there are additional IDs to return, the response also includes a `pagination_token` that you can use to get the next batch of imports. When the response does not include a `pagination_token`, there are no more imports to return.

For guidance and examples, see [Import data](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/import-data).
- [List namespaces](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/listnamespaces.md): List all namespaces in a serverless index.

Up to 100 namespaces are returned at a time by default, in sorted order (bitwise “C” collation). If the `limit` parameter is set, up to that number of namespaces are returned instead. Whenever there are additional namespaces to return, the response also includes a `pagination_token` that you can use to get the next batch of namespaces. When the response does not include a `pagination_token`, there are no more namespaces to return.

For guidance and examples, see [Manage namespaces](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/manage-data/manage-namespaces).

**Note:** This operation is not supported for pod-based indexes.

- [Search with text](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/search_records.md): Search a namespace with a query text, query vector, or record ID and return the most similar records, along with their similarity scores. Optionally, rerank the initial results based on their relevance to the query. 

Searching with text is supported only for indexes with [integrated embedding](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/indexing-overview#vector-embedding). Searching with a query vector or record ID is supported for all indexes. 

For guidance and examples, see [Search](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/search/search-overview).

If a `set_metadata` is included, the values of the fields specified in it will be added or overwrite the previous value.

For guidance and examples, see [Update data](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/manage-data/update-data).
- [Upsert vectors](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/upsert.md): Upsert vectors into a namespace. If a new value is upserted for an existing vector ID, it will overwrite the previous value.

- [Upsert text](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-10/data-plane/upsert_records.md): Upsert text into a namespace. Pinecone converts the text to vectors automatically using the hosted embedding model associated with the index.

Upserting text is supported only for [indexes with integrated embedding](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/api/2025-01/control-plane/create_for_model).

For guidance, examples, and limits, see [Upsert data](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/upsert-data).
